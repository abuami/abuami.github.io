# abuami.github
My website name is "abuami.github.io"
After I create a repository, I create bunch of files in the to add my html and CSS code to be able to demonstrate my website pages such as home and blog.
In Jekyll step I create a specific file that would be allowed to be creating content and connecting them for pages that I make.
then I create a file in the name of about for About page and connected to the main code in “_layout/default.html”.
I add some text as a description, a photo and a website link in the name of “website”.
